Description: mmaqshiny is for analysing, visualising and spatial plotting of 
    high-resolution air quality data collected by specific devices installed on 
    a moving platform. 1 Hz data of PM2.5 (mass concentrations of particulate  
    matter with size less than 2.5 microns), Black carbon mass concentrations 
    (BC), ultra-fine particle number concentrations, carbon dioxide along with 
    GPS coordinates and relative humidity (RH) data collected by popular 
    portable instruments (TSI DustTrak-8530, Aethlabs microAeth-AE51, TSI CPC3007, 
    LICOR Li-830, Garmin GPSMAP 64s, Omega USB RH probe respectively). It 
    incorporates device specific cleaning and correction algorithms. RH correction 
    is applied to DustTrak PM2.5 following the Chakrabarti et al., (2004). 
    Provision is given to add linear regression coefficients for correcting the 
    PM2.5 data (if required). BC data will be cleaned for the vibration generated
    noise, by adopting the statistical procedure as explained in Apte et al., (2011), 
    followed by a loading correction as suggested by Ban-Weiss et al., (2009). 
    For the number concentration data, provision is given for dilution correction 
    factor (if a diluter is used with CPC3007; default value is 1). The package 
    joins the raw, cleaned and corrected data from the above said instruments 
    and outputs as a downloadable csv file.
