Description: The R-Shiny package here is for analysing, visualising and spatial-mapping of high-resolution air quality
    data collected by specific devices installed on a moving platform. 1-Hz data of PM2.5 (mass concentrations of particulate 
    matter with size less than 2.5 microns), Black carbon mass concentrations (BC), ultra-fine particle number concentrations, 
    carbon-di-oxide along with GPS coordinates and relative humidity (RH) data collected by some popular portable instruments 
    (TSI DustTrak-8530, Aethlabs microAeth-AE51, TSI CPC3007, LICOR Li-830, Garmin GPSMAP 64s, Omega USB RH probe respectively) 
    can be handled by this package. It incorporates device-specific cleaning and correction algorithms. RH correction is applied 
    to DustTrak PM2.5 following Chakrabarti et al., (2004). Provision is given to input linear regression coefficients for 
    correcting the PM2.5 data (if required). BC data will be cleaned for the vibration generated noise, by adopting the statistical 
    procedure as explained in Apte et al., (2011), followed by a loading correction as suggested by Ban-Weiss et al., (2009). 
    For the number concentration data, provision is given for dilution correction factor (if a diluter is used with CPC3007; 
    default value is 1). The package joins the raw, cleaned and corrected data from the above said instruments and outputs as a 
    downloadable csv file.
